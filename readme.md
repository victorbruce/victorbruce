# Hi! I'm Victor 👋

I have a passion for Web Development, particularly **Frontend** development. My journey began some years ago when I came across _[Jon Duckett's HTML & CSS: **Design and Build Website**](https://htmlandcssbook.com/)_ book. Since then, I've been dedicated to embracing new challenges, learning and creating engaging **web and mobile experiences**.


- 👨🏽‍💻 I'm currently building custom digital solutions for busineses as a **contractor/freelancer**.

- 📚 I'm currently learning **backend development and trying out new languages and frameworks**.

- ✍️ You can follow and read my **blog posts** on [medium.com/@victorbruce82](https://medium.com/@victorbruce82)

- 💡 **Fun Fact**: I love diving into design trends and experimenting with them in my free time. When not coding, you'll probably find me at the beach or exploring new locations.
